## Changes to ImageResizer.dll core

Added recompilation detection/warning on diagnostics page.
Added explicit Flush call for all I/O operations (helps with certain patch-levels of .NET)
Instructions.CropRectange is now deprecated - use Instructions.CropRectangle instead.

Added ImageJob.SourceWidth, ImageJob.SourceHeigh, ImageJob.ResultFileExtension, ImageJob.ResultMimeType
Fixed bug #45: DefaultSettings doesn't work with w/h

Added ImageBuilder.LoadImageInfo(object source, string[] requestedInfo]
Marked dangerous ImageBuilder methods as obsolete
Added support for Dest type typeof(IDictionary<string, object>) in the default pipeline (forgoes actual build process)
Added ImageJob.ResultInfo
Added ImageJob.RequestedInfo

Changed .SourceWidth, .SourceHeight, .ResultFileExtension, and .ResultMimeType to be read-only, pulling from ResultInfo


Introduced IFileSignatureProvider and added default implementation to DefaultEncoder.

Marked ImageBuilder.LoadImage as Obsolete. Added ImageBuilder.Build(source,dest, Instructions) (returns ImageJob).

### Changes to DiskCache plugin
* Fixed rare bug in DiskCache (serving file that is partially flushed to disk). Only occurs when file system write caching is disabled.
* Fixed: Diskcache blocked any url including the segment /imagecache/, instead of just the root instance. Note that if you have sub-applications, those /imagecache/ folders will be exposed if DiskCache is not installed.

### Changes to SqlReader
* Added support for stored procedures to SqlReader: via QueriesAreStoredProcedures setting.


### Changes to AzureReader2

* Should fix #49 - AzureReader2 redirects incorrectly when hosted in a virtual folder.

Updated MongoReader to 1.8 (Thanks @jakenuts!)
Updated Newtonsoft.Json 
### Changes to Watermark

* Fixes #23. Watermark now throws a 500 error instead of a 404 if a watermark image can't be found.

### Changes to RemoteReader
* Fixed bug in RemoteReader - extension setting was still failing to work.
