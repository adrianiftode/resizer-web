  .span8
    h3 Code name: The Spy
    markdown:
      Until very, *very* recently, Liz was a student of the English language on her way toward a life in academia. She is currently living in an alternate universe where she designs websites and answers IT questions instead. Liz dreads the day when her comic book writers merge the universes and she has to fight canon Liz.

      Dale is an Ohio based software developer, passionate about building and improving the web. He is a co-founder of Moncaí, and works part-time on whatever projects Nathanael chucks at him.
