# Installing the ImageResizer via NuGet

[NuGet](http://nuget.org) is a package manager for .NET, and a pretty good one. It's easy to set up, and friendly to use.

The ImageResizer is published as a NuGet package, as are nearly all of the plugins. If you have [NuGet](http://nuget.org) installed, you can right-click on your project and choose "Add Library Package Reference". Search for "ImageResizer", and you should see a [list of packages](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/nathanaeljones/). Click Install, and you're done. You can install plugins with similar ease, but it's always good to check the [plugin's documentation](/plugins) to see if additional steps are required for activation.

## ImageResizer or ImageResizer.WebConfig ?

If you want to manually modify Web.Config, install the **ImageResizer** package. Otherwise, you can install the **ImageResizer.MvcWebConfig** package, which will install **ImageResizer**, then add the HttpModule and ConfigurationSection registration elements to Web.Config, and install MvcRoutingShim. If you are only running .NET 2.0, install `ImageResizer.WebConfig` insted.

The WebConfig package never deletes anything from your Web.config file, but it may duplicate elements if you have already installed the changes in a slightly different manner.

The WebConfig package is used by most of the sample packages.

If you're using ASP.NET MVC, you can install **ImageResizer.MvcWebConfig** to get everything working in one step. 

**Don't worry! All packages can be safely combined!**
