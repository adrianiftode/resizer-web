# Sync your source with Git


### Connecting to the Git repository

1. If you don't have Git installed, download "Git-1.7.6.Preview" or later from [the msysgit website](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list). Install it.
2.  [Download the SmartGit GUI](http://www.shareit.com/affiliate.html?affiliateid=200142144&publisherid=200020344&target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.syntevo.com%2Fsmartgit%2Findex.html) and install it.
3. Sign up for a GitHub account, and remember your password
4. E-mail your GitHub username to `support@imageresizing.net`, and wait for confirmation that you have been given access. The average wait time is 30 minutes.
5. Then, open SmartGit and `Clone` `https://github.com/imazen/resizer.git`

If you're not sharing code, simply use the NuGet packages to get the latest binaries automatically, and [configure Visual Studio to download sources and symbols](http://www.symbolsource.org/Public/Home/VisualStudio) automatically for debugging.


## Using a private key instead

Instead of entering your password every time in SmartGit, you can create a private key and upload the public portion of that key to your GitHub profile.

If you don't know what your public key is, [download and run this tool](http://windowsgit.com/keytool) to find or generate it for you.
