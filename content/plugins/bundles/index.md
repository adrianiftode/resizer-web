#Plugin Bundles


[19 plugins](/plugins/bundles/free) are included in the free download, and 21 more are sold. The core project is supported by purchases of the paid plugin bundles. 

The licenses are as MIT-like and unrestrictive as possible - even the <span class="price">$99</span> Personal license [allows modification, redistribution, and sub-licensing](/licenses/pro). This 'download fee' allows me to provide support to everyone, develop new features, fix bugs, and write documentation. 

For business use, please get an enterprise-wide license ($249), not a personal ($99) license, even if only one developer is using the software. Continued abuse of the current pricing structure will ensure it gets changed.

By purchasing 1 or more of the bundles below, you will get 

 * Full source code and binaries for **everything** offered on the site, in a single .zip file. I'm trusting you to purchase licenses for the bundles you use.
 * **Free** upgrades for all minor releases (major releases occur every 1-2 years). 
 * Priority e-mail support (includes 1 phone/TeamViewer support incident)
