    p Get on track fast and avoid costly errors. Bronze Support includes a 30-minute architecture consulting call to help you make the most of ImageResizer. It also gives your designated point of contact 1 free priority support incident per month.

    p For only $100 more than an Elite license (which is included!), a 6 month Bronze plan is always a better choice than an Elite license alone.
