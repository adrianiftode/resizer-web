# Support contracts

Save money with a support contract. All contracts include permanent licenses to the latest version of all plugins offered when the contract expires. And even better - you get a direct line to the developers.

### Go Bronze ($1000/yr with 2YR plan)

For only $100 more, there's no reason to buy an Elite license instead of a 6 month Bronze support contract. Both include a lifetime license to the current  version - but only a support contract includes free upgrades to new major relases.

In addition to free major version upgrades, a bronze support contract gives *1 person* at your company access to phone, e-mail, and TeamViewer support once per month. It also includes some free architecture consulting, assisted installations, and custom development.

### Go Silver ($4000/yr with 2YR plan)

The Silver plans (unlike Bronze) allow *any* employee of the business to get direct, unlimited phone & TeamViewer support. No need to funnel all communication through the designated employee. 

Also, you get a special e-mail address to contact support, with 2 business-hour response times guaranteed. Hot-fixes are guaranteed within seven days for blocking bugs. In addition, two hours of architecture planning with the author is included, as well as 3 hours of custom development time if required. 5 assisted installs per year are included.

### Go Gold  ($8500/yr with 2YR plan)

The Gold plans are ideal for business that need access to emergency support, fast issue resolution, or extensive custom development. Hot-fixes are provided within 2 business days. 10 hours of custom coding per year is included, as well as 5 hours of architecture planning and 10 assisted installations.
